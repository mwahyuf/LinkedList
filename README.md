# LinkedList
Hello Everyone ! Today i'll show you how to make a linked list. As we know it, linked list is a every of the nodes to be connected to another nodes. And linked list if we can see it looks like a train
In Linked List we have a carriages which are named Nodes. In one node we have 2 structures, the first is data and the second is Next. 
In Linked List too we have a parts of linked list. It called head and null. Head is a part of linked list who placed in front of from linked list, and then null is placed end of linked list. It named Null because of example : This Node contains a data and it has a next, but the next after this node doesn't have a node again. I mean the end of the part linked list (Null = Nothing).
